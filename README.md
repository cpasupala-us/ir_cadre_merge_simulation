Indian Railways recruits Group A officers via Engineering and Civil Services exams, leading to differing entry ages. Since age impacts promotions, this study examines disparities in higher-post selections and explores ways to ensure equal career progression across all services.

Indian Railways recruits its Group A officers through two channels â€” the Engineering Services Examination and the Civil Services Examination. These entry routes result in officers joining at different ages, creating distinct age profiles across services.
Since age significantly influences promotion timelines, these differences can lead to unequal career progression opportunities, especially when services are merged for consideration to higher posts. Officers from services with a higher average age of entry may face disadvantages in reaching top positions within their career span.

This simulation aims to quantify the extent of disparity caused by these age differences in the selection process for senior posts. It also seeks to explore mechanisms that can neutralize the impact of age on career advancement. The goal is to ensure a level playing field where all services within Indian Railways have equitable prospects for promotion, regardless of their typical age of entry.
